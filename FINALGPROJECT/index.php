                <h2>WELCOME TO THE LEARNEL KERNEL</h2>
                <p>
                Hello potential Learnel Kernel student! Our site is dedicated to teaching Linux to beginners, and beyond just beginners, we aimed to make this site child friendly. Although, some of the language is still probably going to be a little confusing since Linux and technology in general is not the most user friendly.
                We aim to make learning Linux a little bit more fun than your standard school work. We don’t necessarily want you to learn Linux as much as we want to make YOU want to learn Linux. There is still plenty of ground to cover beyond this site, but we’ll give you those training wheels and perhaps a rocket to shoot for the stars! 
                </p>
                <h2>JOIN US!</h2>
                <p>
                Feel free to join us on our learnel kernel adventure through registering an account (just creating a username and password away under the profile page!) so you can access our extended features through the Alma Mater. As you complete quizzes through the lessons with an account, you unlock our Linux poem under the Alma Mater section! Don’t fret if you cannot create an account, all the lessons and quizzes are still available! Accounts just help keep track of your progress to actually unlock the poem.
