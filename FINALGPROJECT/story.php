        <h2>History of Linux</h2>
        <p>
        Linux’s beginnings start with UNIX, another operating system which sparked the creation of many of hierarchical operating systems like Mac OSX. UNIX works a lot like Linux actually and shares a lot of the same commands and components. Though, UNIX was developed out of the Multics project in 1971 at the Bell Laboratories’ Computer Sciences Research Center, starting in 1969. The goal was fairly similar with a hierarchical file structure and a multiuser operating system.
        Eventually the funding was cut for the Multics project but a couple workers continued working on the project and becoming Unix Laboratories. Unix Laboratories created multiple versions of Linux and distributed them to different vendors, and one of these venders developed a distribution of Unix called MINIX, an educational operating system developed in 1987 that would end up being the most important element of the story… because the disliking of MINIX is the influence to creating LINUX.
        Linus Torvalds, a Finnish undergraduate student after he did not wish to work on MINUX anymore due to licensing. In 1991, Linus decided he wanted to make his own free-use open-source operating system and so he did. Linux was born. Different elements used in the creation (some inherited from MINIX and some new from Linus) made up the linux core: the kernel. 
        Similar to Unix, Linux has also developed into multiple distributions, each with different structures and designs to fit different user specifications. All of the Linux distributions follow the open-source elements being free to use with openly available and editable source code.
